## [future] - todo

- [ ] add documentation on using RSYNC in WSL for windows

- [ ] change placeholder home page
- [ ] rework the footer with Dataverse related items
- [ ] consider moving blog posts from [https://dataverse.org/blog] since the navigation of blog posts in OpenScholar is buggy and there is no blog search

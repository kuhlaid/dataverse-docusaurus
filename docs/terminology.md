# Terminology of the Dataverse Project

The Dataverse Project is software, similar to GitHub, that allows the creation of data repositories. Here we  highlight the terminology used with the project.

## Host

A Dataverse host is an installation of the [Dataverse Project software](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse). At Harvard for example, the host can be accessed on the web at [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/]. A host is usually created for an institution for users/researchers to create projects called a Dataverse.

Similar to GitHub, users create repositories, referred to here as Dataverses. A Dataverse can contain any number of files that reside in datasets.

## Datasets

Datasets are containers or folders for files. So while GitHub allows users to drop files directly into a repository root, files in a Dataverse are placed within datasets. Datasets are not simply a named folder to place files. Datasets can have a rich set of metadata applied to them, even before any files are added to the dataset.
